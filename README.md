### Uganda_ClimateSecurity
This project maintains the analytical work for assessing the impacts of climate change on conflicts in Uganda, mediated by various socio-economic variables. 

The data used in this analytical piece come from DHS surveys, UCDP/ACLED conflict datasets, WFP prices & Terradata climate indicators. 

All the survey and admin data are managed using Stata, whereas climate anomalies on temperature & precipitation have been prepared using R - which includes various geospatial data manipulations.
